# Membit
Membit is a simple collection manager application for video game players to be able to manage their personally owned collection of video games. Use it as an inventory system, use it as a database for your own record keeping, the possibilities are endless!

#### User Instructions

Upon accessing Membit, each user is presented with a username login field. If you are a returning user, entering your registered name exactly as it was originally written (case-sensitive) will display your collection of games, pulled from our database. If you are visiting for the first time, entering your username will create a new entry into our database and allow you to search for video games that you can then add to your account.

#### Video Game Search

As mentioned above, when you enter the title of a video game, there is an api call to the Giant Bomb api site, where your game information is retrieved and displayed to the screen. A list of matching search results are displayed, and you can choose the title that most closely matches what you are looking for. The title is accompanied by the image of the game's box art and the platforms the game was developed for. There is also a save button for you to add the game to your collection for future display when you visit the next time to see how your collection has grown.
